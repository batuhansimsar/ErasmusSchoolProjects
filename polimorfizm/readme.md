# Report on Employee Management System

## Introduction
This report provides an overview of the Employee Management System developed in C#. The system is designed to manage various types of employees, including developers, project managers, and analysts. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles, particularly polymorphism, to handle different employee types effectively.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several key files and directories:

### Source Files
- `Employee.cs`: This is the base class for all employee types, containing common properties and methods.
- `Developer.cs`: Inherits from `Employee` and adds specific properties and methods for developers.
- `RemoteDeveloper.cs`: A subclass of `Developer` that includes additional functionality for remote developers.
- `ProjectManager.cs`: Inherits from `Employee` and includes properties specific to project managers.
- `Analyst.cs`: Another subclass of `Employee`, focusing on analysts and their specific attributes.
- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application, containing the logic for managing employees and user interactions.

### Project Files
- `labo.csproj`: The project file that defines the project settings and dependencies.
- `labo.sln`: The solution file that organizes the project and its components.

### Output Directories
- `bin/`: Contains the compiled output of the project.
- `obj/`: Contains intermediate files generated during the build process.

## Class Descriptions

### Employee Class
The `Employee` class serves as the base class for all employee types. It includes properties such as `Id`, `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Salary`. The class also provides a method to increase the salary and a `ToString` method for displaying employee information.

### Developer Class
The `Developer` class inherits from `Employee` and adds a property for the number of technologies the developer is proficient in. It overrides the `IncreaseSalary` method to include a bonus based on the number of technologies.

### RemoteDeveloper Class
The `RemoteDeveloper` class extends `Developer` by adding a property for the distance from the office. It overrides the `IncreaseSalary` method to provide an additional salary increase based on the distance.

### ProjectManager Class
The `ProjectManager` class inherits from `Employee` and includes a property for the number of projects managed. It overrides the `IncreaseSalary` method to provide a salary increase based on the number of projects.

### Analyst Class
The `Analyst` class also inherits from `Employee` and adds a property for the number of clients. Similar to the other classes, it overrides the `IncreaseSalary` method to include a bonus based on the number of clients.

## Main Program Logic
The `Program` class contains the main logic for the application. It initializes a list of employees with sample data and provides a menu for user interaction. Users can perform various actions, such as listing all employees, finding an employee by ID, increasing salaries, and displaying an annual summary of salaries compared to the budget.

## Conclusion
The Employee Management System demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, particularly polymorphism, to manage different types of employees effectively. The project is structured to allow easy maintenance and scalability, making it suitable for real-world applications in employee management.

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements could include:
- Adding a user authentication system.
- Implementing a database for persistent storage of employee data.
- Expanding the types of employees and their specific functionalities.
